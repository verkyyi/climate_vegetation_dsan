# Climate Change and Vegetation Dynamics

Author: Lianghui Yi

## Introduction

In this project, we investigated the relationship between climate change and vegetation dynamics. 

## Data

We used the following datasets:

1. [Climate Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets): This dataset contains information about temperature and precipitation.
2. [Vegetation Data](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-vegetation-monitoring-data): This dataset contains information about vegetation.

## Analysis

We performed the following analyses:

1. Data Preprocessing: We cleaned the data and removed any missing values.
2. Data Exploration: We explored the data to understand the relationship between climate change and vegetation dynamics.
3. Data Visualization: We visualized the data using various plots and charts.
4. Statistical Analysis: We performed statistical analysis to quantify the relationship between climate change and vegetation dynamics.


## Conclusion

TBD
